## NOT READY FOR USE

this repo is only open for the sake of transparency and ease of collaboration.

it aims to work similar to an icecast instance, hosted on a server.

it is supposed to work with the [tau radio](https://github.com/tau-org/webradio) as a drop-in replacement for the icecast listener.
